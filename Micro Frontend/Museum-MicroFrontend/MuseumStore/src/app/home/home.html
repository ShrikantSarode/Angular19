          The VMOA’s free permanent collection spans more than 5,000 years, from
          ancient Egypt to the present, and its 164-acre Museum Park showcases
          the connection between art and nature through site-specific works of
          environmental art.

        <p class="mt-3 p-4">
          VMoA, launched in 2020 by artist Stuart Semple, is the world’s first
          fully virtual art museum. Conceived in 1999 but realized during the
          COVID-19 pandemic, it offers a free, immersive experience with curated
          global artworks. Designed by Emily Mann and curated by Lee Cavaliere,
          VMoA aims to democratize art access and challenge elitism in the art
          world. The Virtual Museum of Art (VMoA), founded by British artist
          Stuart Semple, is the world’s first fully virtual art museum.
          Conceived in 1999 and launched in September 2020, VMoA was born out of
          Semple’s long-standing vision to democratize access to art and
          challenge the exclusivity of traditional institutions. The COVID-19
          pandemic provided the perfect moment to realize this idea, as global
          lockdowns pushed cultural experiences online1. VMoA is not just a
          website—it’s a fully immersive, downloadable museum experience.
          Designed by Emily Mann, the virtual architecture mimics the spatial
          dynamics of a real museum, while the curatorial direction was led by
          Lee Cavaliere, a respected art dealer and curator2. The museum
          features digital surrogates of physical artworks, many on loan from
          major institutions, alongside contemporary pieces from emerging
          artists. This blend of classic and modern art fosters a rich,
          inclusive environment for global audiences. Unlike traditional
          museums, VMoA has no physical building or permanent collection.
